### Hi there 👋
My name is Aidan, I am a University of Waterloo Mechatronics negineering student. This github account includes some of my C++ coding projects. One project is a C++ OpenCV code for a program that converts digital images into text file instructions for a robot dot art printer. Another repository available is one containing C++ projects for a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. These are projects where I have been experimenting and teaching myself about embedded programming. I would recommend checking out the Mutex and FreeRTOS_proj folders for FreeRTOS projects that I have been learning with. As well, the PWM Dimmer program was a neat little program where I learned about the basics of PWM control. If you have any questions, please reach out to me on LinkedIn.
